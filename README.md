### Notes

#### Day 1
- [Project structure suggestions from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zikosa/how_to_organize_rust_code_for_advent_of_code/)
- I should have paid more attention in Rust class.  Rust looked easier from the back of the room than it is to me when coding. ðŸ™‚
- I was studying a top AoC competitor's Rust code for Day 1 ( ["noah r."](https://github.com/50SACINMYSOCIDGAF/AdventOfCode2024) ) and found he used a "sort_unstable()" method call.  I'd never heard term unstable sort (that I recall) and had to look it up ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15125552/what-is-the-meaning-of-stable-and-unstable-for-various-sorting-algorithms)).  Sure enough the [Rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable) say it's faster.

```text
Day 01 Part 1.  What is the total distance between your lists? answer: 1941353
Day 01 Part 2.   What is their similarity score?  answer: 22539317
End.  Current date and time (UTC): 2024-12-01 18:02:49
```

#### Day 2
```text
Day 02 Part 1.  How many reports are safe?  572
Day 02 Part 2.  DNF
End.  Current date and time (UTC): 2024-12-04 01:34:03
```

#### Day 3
- Decided to build a Finite State Machine instead of a regex to parse the input.
- It was a win for Part 1, but took 3.5 hours to get it running.
```text
Day 03 Part 1.  What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications? 178886550
Day 03 Part 2.  ... DNF on same day
End.  Current date and time (UTC): 2024-12-04 04:41:42
```

#### Day 4
- Nifty way to replace chars in a string this using match expression. Link: [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34606043/how-do-i-replace-specific-characters-idiomatically-in-rust)
```rust
   let s:String = input.chars()
   .map(|x| match x {
   '\n' => ' ',
   _ => x
   }).collect();
```
- How to find overlapping matches.  Look ahead:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11430863/how-to-find-overlapping-matches-with-a-regexp
- DNF - TODO

#### Day 5
- DNF

#### Day 6
- Used straightforward implementation representing grid as nested vector.
- Got help laying out grid's implementation with origin top-left and referencing the data 
as the familiar (row, column) or (x,y)  style Cartestion coords 
from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13212212/creating-two-dimensional-arrays-in-rust)
```text
Day 06 Part 1.  How many distinct positions will the guard visit before leaving the mapped area?  4826 (out of 5517 loop cycles)
Day 06 Part 2.  DNF/TODO
End.  Current date and time (UTC): 2024-12-07 04:47:19
```

#### Day 7
- TBD
